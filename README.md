Stupid fast in-memory Go cache with optional L2 persistence layer.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/bdcache
```

## Use

```go
import (
    "github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/bdcache"
    "github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/bdcache/persist/localfs"
)

// Memory only
cache, _ := bdcache.New[string, int](ctx)
cache.Set(ctx, "answer", 42, 0)           // Synchronous: returns after persistence completes
cache.SetAsync(ctx, "answer", 42, 0)      // Async: returns immediately, persists in background
val, found, _ := cache.Get(ctx, "answer")

// With local file persistence
p, _ := localfs.New[string, User]("myapp", "")
cache, _ := bdcache.New[string, User](ctx,
    bdcache.WithPersistence(p))

// With Valkey/Redis persistence
p, _ := valkey.New[string, User](ctx, "myapp", "localhost:6379")
cache, _ := bdcache.New[string, User](ctx,
    bdcache.WithPersistence(p))

// Cloud Run auto-detection (datastore in Cloud Run, localfs elsewhere)
p, _ := cloudrun.New[string, User](ctx, "myapp")
cache, _ := bdcache.New[string, User](ctx,
    bdcache.WithPersistence(p))
```

## Features

- **Faster than a bat out of hell** - Low latency, high throughput
- **S3-FIFO eviction** - Better hit-rates than LRU ([learn more](https://s3fifo.com/))
- **Pluggable persistence** - Bring your own database or use built-in backends:
  - [`persist/localfs`](persist/localfs) - Local files (gob encoding, zero dependencies)
  - [`persist/datastore`](persist/datastore) - Google Cloud Datastore
  - [`persist/valkey`](persist/valkey) - Valkey/Redis
  - [`persist/cloudrun`](persist/cloudrun) - Auto-detect Cloud Run
- **Per-item TTL** - Optional expiration
- **Graceful degradation** - Cache works even if persistence fails
- **Zero allocation reads** - minimal GC thrashing
- **Type safe** - Go generics

## Performance against the Competition

bdcache prioritizes high hit-rates and low read latency, but it performs quite well all around.

Here's the results from an M4 MacBook Pro - run `make bench` to see the results for yourself:

NOTE: Performance characteristics often have trade-offs. There are almost certainly workloads where other cache implementations are faster, but nobody blends speed and persistence the way that bdcache does.
